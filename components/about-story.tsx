              <p>
                My journey into holistic wellness began with my own experience of chronic pain and stress. As a former
                corporate executive, I spent years pushing through physical discomfort and emotional exhaustion,
                believing that was simply the price of success.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything changed when I discovered fascial stretch therapy during my own recovery from a sports
                injury. The profound transformation I experienced – not just physically, but emotionally and mentally –
                opened my eyes to the incredible healing potential that exists within each of us.

            <div className="space-y-4">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif font-semibold text-primary">The Transformation</h3>
              <p>
                This personal breakthrough inspired me to leave my corporate career and dedicate my life to helping
                others discover their own healing potential. I immersed myself in studying the fascia, the nervous
                system, and the profound connection between breath, movement, and emotional well-being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through extensive training in fascial stretch therapy, breathwork, spinal energetics, and
                neuro-linguistic programming, I developed a comprehensive approach that addresses the whole person –
                body, mind, and spirit.

              <p>
                Today, I'm passionate about creating a safe, nurturing space where individuals can reconnect with their
                body's innate wisdom and healing capacity. I believe that true wellness isn't just the absence of pain
                or dysfunction – it's the presence of vitality, joy, and a deep sense of connection to ourselves and our
                purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every session I offer is an opportunity to witness the remarkable resilience and healing potential that
                exists within each person. It's an honor to be part of my clients' wellness journeys and to help them
                discover what's possible when we work with the body's natural intelligence rather than against it.
